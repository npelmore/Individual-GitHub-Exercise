# Individual-GitHub-Exercise

Exercise for github

My code for the exercise allows the user to compare two integers or two strings.

First, the user is prompted to enter either 1 or 2 into the console. 1 is for comparing integers and 2 is for comparing strings.

Feature 1 (intComnpare branch): The user is prompted to enter one integer and then another integer. The two numbers are compared and then the user is told which is greater.

Feature 2 (strCompare branch): The user is prompted to enter a string and then another string. The length of the strings are compared, and then the user is told which one is longer.
